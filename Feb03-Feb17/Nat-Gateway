NAT instance : Network address translation.

The main purpose of NAT instance is to grant or provide internet access to privatesubnet.

In general ==>>> database , backup , storage instances are no need of internet access..

private subnet : database , backup , storage ..etc ==>> update or upgrade ==>>> then these instances required internet access..

NAT instance thumbrule :

NAT instance must be launched in public subnet.

inbound rules / inbound access / inbound traffic ==>> internet ==>> internetgatway to ec2 instance

outbound rules / outbound access / outbound traffic ==>> internet ==>> ec2instance to  internetgatway

NAT follows outbound rules..

NAT instance ==>> launch instance ==>>> community AMI's ===>> search ==>>> nat ===>> no .of nat instances to display ==>> choose any one ==>>> normal ec2 instance creation steps..

select NAT instance ==>> actions ==>>> networking ==>> change source/destination check ==>> defaultly enable state. ===>>> we will do this desable ==>> stop ( check box ==>> check).

==>> first NAt instance ===>> Db instance ==>> SSH configuration. ==>> now you are in db instance..

NATGATEWAY : to grant or provide internet access to private subnet.

NATgateway also follows outbound traffic..

public subnet : web servers

privatesubnet : database , storage , backup , ... ( publicly not accessable) -->> no public IP i.e private Ip

NATgateway : high availability and it is maintaintained by AWS.

NAt instance -->> not having  high availability and it is maintained by us.

NAT instance also we make it as high availability  --->> script --->>> HA .

NAt instance must be launched in public subnet -->> community AMI's -->> search -->nat

Natgateway must be launched in public subnet.

Natgateway is the same process of infrastructure creating of NAT instance..

VPC --->>> NGVPC -->> 30.20.0.0/16

IGW -->> NGIGW -->> attach -->> NGVPC

create two subnets -->> 1. ngpublicsubnet 2. ngprivatesubnet

MRTB -->>attach -->>IGW and ngpublicsubnet

create one ec2 instance ( normal ) under public subnet.

create --->>NATGATEWAY --->> public subnet.

note : natgateway must having elastic IP 

CRTB --->>> 0.0.0.0/0 --->> natgateway and attach ngprivate subnet

create one more instance --->> under privatesubnet ( storage) --->>> autoassign publicip -->>desable

final : login into the public subnet instance -->> configure ssh configuration --->>>> login into storage instance with the help of private IP
